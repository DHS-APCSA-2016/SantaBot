PROJECT TITLE: SantaBot

VERSION or DATE: December 2, 2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method in Runner
AUTHORS: Ethan Alcantara and Pranav Konduru
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

3) Continue Step #2 as long as you want
4) When you want to end the conversation, say "bye" or "goodbye"

Capitalisation and punctuation shouldn't matter.

PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS:
- Unique code includes:
- Turning statement into an array changed a lot of the code, we decided to go with this 
since we wouldn't have to worry about things like how "no" is in "know"
- Extra methods because we had to make the statement into an array
- Print statements that say "Santa:" and "You:"
- Context checker, can see what was previously said
- Transform method, can change the input into a proper output
